Re: Submission of Manuscript: “A Quantum-Integrated Systems Framework for Epilepsy”

Dear Dr. [Editor’s Name],

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled “A Quantum-Integrated Systems Framework for Epilepsy: From Mitochondrial Collapse to Biophotonic Modulation and AI-Driven Intervention” for consideration in your esteemed journal.

This manuscript presents the world’s first epilepsy treatment model that integrates quantum biology, the endocannabinoid system (ECS), programmed cell death (PCD), and systems neuroscience into a single therapeutic architecture. Through a codex of over 80 unique seizure triggers, mapped across miRNAs, voltage gates, immune tone, quantum cellular signatures, and therapeutic light frequencies, we present a novel AI-compatible framework with immediate clinical and technological implications.

Our work addresses major gaps in current epilepsy management, particularly drug-resistant epilepsy, and proposes a systems-based, multidimensional intervention logic that unifies metabolic, immune, neural, and quantum biology into a deployable therapeutic model. We believe this paper will be of interest to your readership given the urgency of neurologically precise treatment strategies in molecular pharmacology.

This submission is original, not under review elsewhere, and we have no conflicts of interest to declare. We have included a visual explainer infographic to support reader clarity and interdisciplinary utility.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your Special Issue.

Sincerely,
Anwar Mohamed
